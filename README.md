# FriendFinder
The Friend Finder survey takes in user responses, then compares their answers with those from other users. The scores for each question are compared against one another, and the absolute differences (i.e., no negative values) are calculated to determine which user's scores are the least different from the user taking the survey.\

As of 11/03/2018, this is a work in progress; most notably, modal functionality and handling CORB (cross-origin read blocking) with image links.\
